## 1. Project Introduction
### ‚úàÔ∏è Bridging Travel Info Gaps for the Visually Impaired.

### What's the Problem?
Travel information is plentiful, but it is often too ‚Äúbig‚Äù and ‚Äúvisually centric‚Äù for people with visual impairments.

We provide review summaries, audio guides and disability information to help visually impaired people plan their own trips and reduce barriers to accessing information easily.
